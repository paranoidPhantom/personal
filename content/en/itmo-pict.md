### Theory and practice

To participate in the hackathon, we were required to solve a math quiz consisting of 10 problems. Only a limited number of people could proceed.

### Here is _one_ of the problems:

Find the last digit of the number

#### ${2023} ^ {{2023} ^ {{2024} ^ {{...} ^ {2024}}}}$

Where 2024 is repeated 2024 times.

#### Thankfully most of my team proceeded to the next round.

### The hackathon

The problem was to create a comprehensive platform for students to search for internships. The obvious way of doing this, was to aggregate them from multiple sites i.e. scrape them in order to populate our resource.

Our presentation describes our stack and UI very well:

We worked as a team, we worked as long as we could, and even as long as we couldn't (_we were late for our presentation_).

#### To our surprise, our product was the most functional in the track, and we won!
