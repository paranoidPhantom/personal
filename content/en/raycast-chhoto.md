I love [chhoto-url](https://github.com/SinTan1729/chhoto-url), the self-hosted URL shortener written in Rust. I wanted to make it more efficient to use, so I created a raycast extension.

The extension [recieved aknowledgement from the maintainer](https://github.com/SinTan1729/chhoto-url#raycast-extension) of chhoto-url and is now available [on the Raycast store](https://www.raycast.com/andrei_hudalla/chhoto).

You can read more about it [in this article on Habr](https://habr.com/ru/articles/919354/) (in Russian).
