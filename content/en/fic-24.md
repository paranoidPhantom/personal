## The case

The case was to create a 3D map of underground utility networks. It was really about drawing cylinders between coordinate nodes, coloring them in descriptive ways, and storing them in a database for collaborative map population.

> Utility networks, in the given context, means power lines, water pipes, sewage systems etc.

We were basically forced into using [Cesium.js](https://cesium.com/), because an alternative like [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org) would be unforgivably time consuming, although in my opinion, better more maintainable and usable in the long run..

This was by no means a positive experience and I to some extent hate the library now... Nevertheless, we managed to get the closest to a real product in the time given and deliver a half-baked prototype.

You can, traditionally check out the presentation that our designer did a splendid job on:
