## The task

Our goal was to create a VK Mini App using [VK UI](https://vkcom.github.io/VKUI/#/QuickStart).

Since I am not a React guy this was a chance to look into it more vs. the traditional Vue approach.

> Spoiler: I didn't enjoy it.

The app was meant to introduce 'be ITMO' culture. This meant we had to combine two design systems.

This was the designer's problem though, so you can read more in [his chain of posts](https://t.me/zloon41/60).

## The prizes

Prize money was divided as follows:

1. 200,000₽ (~$2,020)
2. 150,000₽ (~$1,515)
3. 100,000₽ (~$1,010)

## Beyond the theory

This all sounds great until you take into consideration that I had to work 8 hour shifts every day of the hackathon.

Because of this I was able to do very little and on the last day I was forced to do something crazy...

On the last day, I asked for a shorter shift and got a lot done in the morning - 5 PM to 11 PM.

The backend was almost done the morning of that day, and completely done by the end of my shift.

And so, after writing code for 7 hours, and then washing dishes for 6, I grabbed a protein bar, some water and some pesto chicken, and jumped back into VS Code.

-   12:45 - I was able to fetch tasks and store items from the API and display them

You get the idea. Little by little everything got implemented in the most minimal way possible.

-   6:04 - We were finishing the details like user profiles

...and quizzes about 'be ITMO' culture:

## The result

Our presentation is a great demonstration of what we did:
