## The stages

### Stage 1 - [General CS quiz](https://vk.com/wall-223720604_61)

This stage was a general CS quiz:
- We were given 2 hours to solve 30 questions.
- 3879 contestants attempted the quiz.
- It tested our knowledge on web fundamentals, and general CS knowledge.

### Stage 2 - Track based task

The competition was divided into frontend, backend, and mobile development.

I picked frontend. The task can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Central-University-IT/test-frontend).

In short, we were tasked to build a resume builder in pure JS/CSS following strict design guidelines and prewritten playwright tests.

I got a 98.5/100 score with a 71/100 passing score *making me top 6* in this stage of the competition.

### Stage 3.1 - Individual project

I was given the task to build a habit tracker. The task can be viewed [here](https://centraluniversity.notion.site/Frontend-71498a423396498ea874cd9cd7c48bd0).

In short, it had to implement gamification, add social mechanics. I was one of the few that hooked this up to a backend ([Supabase](https://supabase.com/)).

This allowed me to have actual friend requests, an actual library of popular habits, and actual profile pages with results.

You can check out the final result [here](https://github.com/Central-University-IT-prod/public-frontend-paranoidPhantom).

### Stage 3.2 - Team hackathon

This was the only part of the competition that was hosted at a physical location. It was a 4 day hackathon, with multiple cases that could be picked.

My team picked a case about optimizing feedback collection for businesses.

We developed a prototype: it had a dashboard for businesses to manage questions, and analyze feedback. We even integrated it with a LLM called YandexGPT that would analyze questions and feedback for those questions and suggest how to improve metrics.


We had to present the result of our 4 days of work to 30 judges from the industry.
