## Project Overview

During the hackathon, out team developed a machine learning model to predict cashback payouts based on many parameters.

Our solution aimed to help Tinkoff make companies more comfortable in the partner program by setting predictable payout amounts.

## Our solution

I was, as usual, responsible for everything frontend. Staying up all night, I implemented the dashboard for making requests to the model.
I used Nuxt 3 + Nuxt UI to make a nice interace quickly.

You can get a good feeling for our work using the presentation below.
