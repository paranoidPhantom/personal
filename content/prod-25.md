## Stages

Given my previous year's award, I automatically advanced to the finals.

### Individual project

The task was to create a fitness tracker that would help create workouts and stay motivated.

I used Nuxt 3 and shadcn/vue to create a user-friendly mobile-first web-app.

For the individual stage, I received 73 points.

### Team hackathon

This was the only stage of the competition that was held in person. It was a four-day hackathon with several cases to choose from.

In the team, I served as the team lead and frontend developer. In total, we had 3 frontend developers and 2 backend developers.
We chose an unpopular case: a service for exchanging books. Essentially, we needed to allow people to donate unwanted books to specially equipped locations to give them a second life with a new owner.

For the team stage, we received 80 points.
