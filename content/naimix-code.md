## The case

When we heard the case for the first time, we thought it was a joke. We were supposed to use comograms and horoscopes to analyze job applicants.

Unfortunately, it was not a joke.

## Our work

My whole team worked like crazy for this one. Designs were extensive, the backend was complex, and the frontend was huge.

On the last day, I ***literally*** got in my chair at 6 AM and stayed there until 6 PM.

As usual, Nuxt 3 + Nuxt UI was the stack on my end. FastAPI + PostgreSQL on the backend.

## The result:

We got 2nd place & won 60,000 rubles.
